            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey guys, my name is Shaheer Khan! I'm a Data Science student at UC San Diego who loves diving into challenges headfirst. When I'm not buried in code, I'm building things that actually matter to people. I founded The Kaizen Academy because I believe education should be exciting and relevant—not just textbooks and lectures. My tech journey has taken me from tinkering with robots at Dublin Robotics to fine-tuning AI models during my time at QuickCruit.AI.</p>
            
            <p>I'm the kind of person who gets excited about both sides of tech—I can get lost for hours perfecting frontend interfaces with React and TypeScript, but I'm equally at home building drones that track environmental pollution (a project that actually scored $10K in funding!). My proudest achievement? Starting the first-ever IEEE Student Branch at a community college in the US and leading it to win first place at the Rising Stars Conference.</p>
            
            <p>My Canadian-Pakistani heritage gives me a unique lens on problem-solving, and I bring that perspective to everything from my role as VP of UCSD's Pakistani Student Association to the AI networking tool I built at Berkeley's Hackathon. Outside the digital world, I'm constantly chasing new thrills—recently picked up surfing and snowboarding, which perfectly balance out the hours I spend building systems. Oh, and if we ever grab lunch, I'll definitely recommend the chicken biryani—life-changing stuff!</p>
